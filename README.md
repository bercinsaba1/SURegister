### Project Overview

We designed a program that will be helpful to Sabancı University students during course registrations and add-drop period. The program will take data from the Sabanci University student resource website and show users if the class they are planning to register for is empty or not. Moreover, it will calculate and show the possibility they may register for the class based on other users’ inputs. The program allows users to see how many people are planning to take the courses they choose before the course registration day, enabling them to plan their schedule accordingly.

### Objective and Scope of the Project

The completion of this project aims to enable Sabancı University students to spend their add-drop and course selection periods more efficiently. At the back-end, we aim to provide information on course capacity and registration days, the user’s education level, and their intended courses. In the front-end, our app will have a main page, a user panel page, and pages for particular courses, totaling 3-4 screens.

### Background and Current Practice

CampusNet and SUchedule are two main examples in the proposed project area. CampusNet allows students to recommend courses and make comments, but lacks specific course tracking. SUchedule helps in semester planning but does not allow comments or sharing plans. SUregister aims to address these limitations.

### Potential Customer/User Description

Our system will inform Sabancı University students about risky courses and prompt them to plan alternative schedules. The program targets students unsure about their course selections and those needing to prepare different schedules.
